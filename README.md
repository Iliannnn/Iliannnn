### *Minecraft addict by day, genius coder by night..*

### About Me:
Heyo! As you may already know my name is Ilian, I live in Belgium in the province West-Flanders and what you may have read is that I love playing Minecraft and coding, mostly I do stuff such like making Discord bots, CLI's, website back-end in JavaScript or PHP but sometimes I use other languages such as HTML/CSS too!
I am also often online on Discord to have a chat! In my spare time I often watch
YouTube or scroll over nice pages on social media! I also really enjoy working
with Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro
to make creative stuff, such things like editing photos or adding effects to video's/GIF's,
or just drawing fun anime's, nice right?

### My Current Goals: 
- Improving my PHP skills.
- Finishing my 200k+ JSON api called **PgData** .-.
