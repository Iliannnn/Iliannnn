# Heyo! üî•

## Nice to meet you! Yeah! I'm that guy Ilian. Sure, I'm the one that is so bad at making nicknames so just take his first name everywhere, nice right?

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About me:
`Hey, as you may already know my name is Ilian, I live in Belgium in the province West-Flanders and I am involved in
coding! Mostly I do stuff such like JavaScript making Discord Bots but sometimes other languages! Such as HTML/CSS
I am also often online on Discord to have a chat! In my spare time I often watch
YouTube or scroll over nice pages on social media! I also really enjoy working
with Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects or Adobe Premiere Pro
to make creative stuff, such things like editing photos or adding effects to Video's/GIF's
or just drawing fun anime's, nice right?`

### üîÆ My Current Goals: 
- Finishing and lauching my upcoming bot Bixie!
- Learn how to use JavaScript in a HTML Website work as back-end language.
- Trying to make my own Code Language :)
